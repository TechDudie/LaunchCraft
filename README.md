# LaunchCraft

Okay, I'll get right into it. You want a Minecraft launcher that's portable, supports Microsoft Login, and is cross-platform (hello, Raspberry Pi owners!)

...what's that? That isn't the reason? Okay...

You're a kid who has the Minecraft Launcher blocked on your computer or laptop and you want to play Minecraft.

...what's that? That still isn't the reason? Whatever.

LaunchCraft is a lightweight and portable cross-platform Minecraft launcher that can save and launch multiple instances of Minecraft from the desktop or terminal, and contains built-in tricks to evade Screen Time and other parental controls.
